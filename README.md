# Mini-Challenge 1 - High Performance Computing (hpc) HS22

## Containers, Communication Patterns/Frameworks and Performance Analysis

You have a client that continuously accumulates data and wants to process it further. To do this, the client wants to use the [Apache Kafka - Data Streaming Platform](https://kafka.apache.org/) in a first step. In a a second step it will use a different communication pattern. The application runs distributed in different Docker containers. Define what kind of data your client has and what problem they want to solve with it. Describe the initial situation and the problem to be solved in about 200 words. Then implement your methods according to the tasks below.

### Part 1: Kafka Cluster and Application Setup

1. Set up Kafka locally on your computer, e.g. according to [this Kafka tutorial](https://github.com/mneedham/basic-kafka-tutorial.git). 
Note, the Docker Compose file available in the repository contains more containers than in the linked source repository.

2. Start the existing Docker containers for the Kafka cluster (Kafka Brokers and Zookeeper) locally on your computer/laptop including a Jupyter notebook. Command line:`$docker-compose up`. Verify e.g. with Docker Desktop if all containers have been started. 

    We start with a Docker compose template, which launches 6 containers:

    * broker-<x> - Kafka brokers
    * zookeeper - is used by Kafka for the leader election
    * Jupyter - Jupyter environment for the connection to our Kafka cluster using notebooks
    * kafdrop - web UI for browsing and monitoring Kafka clusters

    Note: every now and then a broker exits during startup. Just manually restart it.

3. Open the Jupyter notebook. The link to the Jupyter notebook is in the log file of the Jupyter container. The link looks something like this, where the token is individual: http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=e3cea84dbec991e60795ee749817392f73960184cc5e5c84

4. Run the Kafka tutorial of the notebook. Use [Kafdrop]( https://github.com/obsidiandynamics/kafdrop) to monitor/explore your cluster, topics, and messages. For example, start and stop individual brokers (via Docker Desktop) or change Kafka parameters such as the replication factor and watch how the cluster behaves via Kafdrop. Describe your experiments and observations in about 150 words.

5. Write two different data generator functions, which regularly send messages containing data. One generator should send messages at least every second (1Hz). Choose yourself which data is sent. The application of the data can be chosen freely, but choose a good mixture of a simple and a complex message. The data should be variable. The data generator can send simulated data or real data. Use suitable Kafka components and meaningful names of functions, variables etc. for the implementation. 

    Tips:
    * Use several notebooks such that you can start and stop the endless loops of data processing individually.
    * After testing, stop the endless loop again otherwise your computer resources are unnecessarily occupied or at the limit.

6. Write a data processor and a data sink. The data processor should regularly read and process the data from the data generators. E.g., a calculation or a machine learning application on the retrieved data; a data enrichment; or the extraction of information from the message. Then the processor sends the data to a data sink. In the data sink the data is stored, e.g. in a CSV file. Use appropriate Kafka components and meaningful names of functions, variables, etc. for the implementation. 

7. Draw an overview of your application components including interfaces and data flows, for example using a component diagram. Answer the following questions and interpret your experiments or results in about 300 words: 
    
      * What are the tasks of the components?
      * Which interfaces do the components have?
      * Why did you decide to use these components? 
      * Are there any other design decisions you have made? Which requirements (e.g. libraries, hardware, ...) does a component have?

#### Bonus 1
Use other serializers/deserializers instead of JSON for the messages.

### Part 2: Communication Patterns

1. Rewrite your application of part 1 using another communication pattern. You can also use another communciation framework, such as RabbitMQ and/or another underlying messaging protcol such as MQTT.
    
2. Pack your rewritten application into containers. Describe the used containers and how they interact with each other using a diagram. 
    
3. 

4. Answer the following questions and interpret your experiments or results in about 300 words: 
      * Which communication pattern is used by Kafka?
      * What is the difference compared to your choosen pattern?
      * What are the advantages and disadvantages of these patterns? 
      * How can you scale the two different approaches? What are ? Why? What are challenges to be considered?
      * What other 2-3 topologies/patterns do you know used for data processing? Describe the differences and use cases with at least one additional topology. 
      * Which pattern suits your chosen application best?

#### Bonus 2
Show how your container setup could be integrated into a container orchestration system (such as Kubernets) and how it would profit from this. Or show how you could replace some of the components with cloud-based offers and what changes/consideradtions come with this.

### Part 3: Performance Analysis and Evaluation

1. Change the scalability of your communication framework by changing the used resources. (E.g.: add brokers and/or zookeepers and play with parameters in the docker-compose file. Use orders of magnited more producers/consumers.) Perform 2-3 experiments with different configurations. Document your experiments and their results appropriately (e.g. by video recording). Discuss the results in about 200 words.

2. Analyze the performance of your application:

    * Data generators: measure the average time incl. standard deviation required by your data generator loop over several runs and loops. Determine a reasonable number of runs and loop executions for the performance analysis. 
    * Data processor: determine which call of your processor takes the most time. Which 3 methods are called the most or needed the most time and how much time?
    * Data processor: create a profile of your processor code in a processor.prof file and create 1-2 visualizations of the profile (e.g. with [SnakeViz](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/)).
    * Data generators, data processor, data sink: Create a profile of memory usage and output the first 3 most memory-hungry methods.

3. Did you detect bottlenecks? Describe and discuss 1-3 detected bottlenecks in about 200-300 words. 

4. Answer the following questions and interpret your experiments or results in about 300 words: 
      * Is the data processor/generator IO or CPU bound? Why?
      * 


#### Bonus 3
Mitigate or produce a bottleneck.


## Reflection

Write a reflection on the realization of the mini-challenge in about 300-500 words. What went well? Where did problems occur? Where did you need more time than planned? 
What would you do differently in the future? What would you change in the assignment? Give examples in each case.


#### Bonus  3
Optionally, a learning diary (Lerntagebuch) may be included with the submission, which documents daily how the learning progress was. 
For example, briefly answer a few questions, analogous to a daily scrum meeting. What did you do that day? What was successful? Where are there currently problems? 
Who could help with these problems?
